# Final Project MVP

The purpose of the MVP is to provide a check in for progress of the project. It is meant to provide a midway point of the final project and groups are to expand upon in the coming weeks for the final project presentation (usually held during final exams week). 

MVP should:
* include a brief description of the project idea (abstract)
* have some minimal set of features that show an initial state of the application
* demonstrate a basic knowledge of your project and an initial feature set that will grow and be developed upon for the final project presentation
* have explanatations of why deviations from the proposal have been taken and how they were/are handled (deviations are not only acceptable but encouraged)

Use github to host your code (so I can review code and provide comments).
