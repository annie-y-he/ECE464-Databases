# Final Project Description

Each group will have a total of ten minutes to demo their project, including setup and any class interaction that you plan. If you plan to allow Q&A, or accept sample queries from the class, etc., you must plan that as part of your time. If it takes you several minutes to connect a laptop and get the projector working, that also counts as part of your ten minutes. Your demos should indicate to the class your project idea, what features are / are not working, how you populated the database, etc. Presumably you will be able to showcase a working system.

Additionally, each group should submit a single write-up. There should be only one submission per group. I expect the write-ups to be a few pages in length. This should include:
* A brief 	description of the project idea (abstract)
* Any changes 	that were made to proposed functionality since the project 	proposals, along with the reasons for the changes.
* Any significant changes that were made to the database schema since the 	schemas were submitted, along with the reasons for the changes.
* A description of the data in the database, including where it came from or how it was generated, and also the approximate number of entries in each table.
* A description 	of the functionality (feel free to include screen captures of the 	interface if appropriate).
* A description of any known bugs or features that you were unable to finish, along 	with explanations of why.
If appropriate, instructions for how I could try out the system on my own (make it easy for me to do so).
* A breakdown of work across all project members
* A short conclusion indicating final thoughts about the project.
* Anything else 	you want to add.

Use github to host your code (so I can review code and provide comments).
